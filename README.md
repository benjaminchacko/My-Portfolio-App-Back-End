## Project Description

This repository is the Express.js backend part of my school portfolio app I built in 2019 after graduating from Bethel School of Technology with a Certificate in Web Development.

In November 2021, I updated the project with some of my recent growth in knowledge, including:

- added nodemon.json, .eslintrc.json & .prettierrc.json config files
- destructuring id and body from request object in API routes
- changing API routes to use the "async/await" and "try/catch" syntax from previous ".then" syntax
- refactoring the project structure
- further documentation of the project.
